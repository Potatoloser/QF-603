\pdfbookmark[1]{Problem 1}{p1}
\textbf{Problem 1.}
Based on the Assumptions of OLS:
\[
\begin{aligned}
    E(e_{i}) &= 0\ \rm{for\ every}\ i \\
    E(e_{i}^2) &= \sigma_{e}^2  \\
    E(e_{i}e_{j}) &= 0\ \rm{for\ every}\ i,j \\
    X_{i},&e_{j}\ \rm{are\ independent\ for\ each}\ i,j \\
    e_{i}&\stackrel{d}{\sim}N(0,\sigma_{e}^2)
\end{aligned}
\]

The answer is 3.
\\

\pdfbookmark[2]{Problem 2}{p2}
\textbf{Problem 2.}

\[
\begin{aligned}
\rm{Annual\ Return\ Volatility} &= \rm{Daily\ Return\ Volatility} \times \sqrt{\rm{trade days}}\\
                        &= 0.5 \% \times \sqrt{252}\\
                        &= 7.93 \%
\end{aligned}
\]

So the answer is 1.\ 7.93\%.
\\

\pdfbookmark[3]{Problem 3}{p3}
\textbf{Problem 3.}

Ordered probit regression is for dependent variable which takes a number of infinite and discrete values that contain ordinal information.

So the answer is 2.\ Ordered probit regression.
\\

\pdfbookmark[4]{Problem 4}{p4}
\textbf{Problem 4.}

Total number of heads follow the Binomial Distribution. According to

\[
Var(X) = np(1-p)
\]

So the answer is $100p(1-p)$.
\\

\pdfbookmark[5]{Problem 5}{p5}
\textbf{Problem 5.}

According to the concept of Uniform Distribution, we have probability distribution function of $x$:

\[
f(x)=
\begin{cases}

\frac{1}{5}       & 5\leq x \leq10 \\
0  &  \rm{other} 

\end{cases}
\]

So we can calculate variance of X by

\[
\begin{aligned}
E(X) &= \int_{X_1}^{X_2}f(x)x dx = \int_{5}^{10}\frac{1}{5}x dx\\
&=7.5\\
E(X^2) &= \int_{X_1}^{X_2}f(x)x^2 dx = \int_{5}^{10}\frac{1}{5}x^2 dx\\
&=\frac{175}{3}\\
Var(X) &= E(X^2) - E(X)^2 = \frac{175}{3} - 7.5^2\\
&=\frac{25}{12}
\end{aligned}
\]

So the variance of x is $\frac{25}{12}$.
\\

\pdfbookmark[6]{Problem 6}{p6}
\textbf{Problem 6.}

The cumulative distribution function of defaults in portfolio is 

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}(X = n) &= \frac{\lambda^n}{n!}e^{-\lambda}\\
&=\frac{10^n}{n!}e^{-10}
\end{aligned}
\]

So in one year, the probability that there are exactly 2 defaults is 

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}(X = 2) &= \frac{10^2}{2!}e^{-10}\\
&= 50e^{-10}\\
&\approx 0.23 \%
\end{aligned}
\]

In two years, the probability that there are exactly 2 defaults is 

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}(X = 2) &= \frac{20^2}{2!}e^{-20}\\
&= 200e^{-20}\\
&\approx 4.12\times 10^{-5} \%
\end{aligned}
\]
